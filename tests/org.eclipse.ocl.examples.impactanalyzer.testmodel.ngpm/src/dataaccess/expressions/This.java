/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc -->
 * A representation of the model object '<em><b>This</b></em>'.

 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * Statically, the This expression has the type that owns its occurrence. This means, in order to determine this, the getType implementation needs to ascend the composition hierarchy until it finds a Class somewhere. The problem, again, is that an OCL expression cannot manufacture the result required becauce currently TypeDefinition is still an "entity type," meaning a MOF class whose instances have ID and an explicit life cycle.
 * 
 * Therefore, currently This has to own its type definition, unfortunately.
