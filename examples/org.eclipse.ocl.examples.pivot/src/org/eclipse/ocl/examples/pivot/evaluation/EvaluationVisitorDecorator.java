 * visitation is simply delegated to the decorated visitor.  Subclasses may
 * extend these delegations with any additional behaviour that is required,
 * even replacing calls to the delegate where necessary.
 * <p>
 * This class works together with the {@link AbstractEvaluationVisitor} to
 * ensure that recursive <code>visitXxx()</code> calls are correctly intercepted
 * by me (and not just implemented within the decorated visitor).  Moreover,
 * this works with decorators nested to any depth.
